//im gonna rehaul the script and try something else because after doing more research, this looks like a better idea. if im wrong and this doesnt work in the lab, i can just revert to the previous script
//the first idea (see git history) was simple threshold rules: if browLower > 0.3 then anger, etc.
//the problem with that was basically a first match wins scenario, so if two emotions overlapped the order decided it, not the strongest signal
//after researching this concern a bit more, i switched to something i found in a paper called cosine similarity instead
//the idea is you build a vector of the face's action units and compare it to a template vector per emotion
//the technique comes from a 2026 paper (Sensors, Aldenhoven et al., https://doi.org/10.3390/s26031060) on ARKit blendshapes (cosine similarity scored 68% and beat the average human rater of 59%)
//the actual muscle combos in the templates come from Ekman and Friesens EM-FACS
//i wrote the code myself for the Quest Pro, the paper studies iPhone ARKit and doesnt give Unity code
//contempt is kept as a separate asymmetry check since cosine similarity cant catch a one-sided lip pull

  //this is the Meta component that gives the 63 FACS values

  //this string is so other scripts like the UI display can read the current emotion
  public string CurrentEmotion{get; private set;} = "Neutral";

  //how strong a blendshape has to be like between 0 and 1, before we count it as "active"
  //i made this public so we can tune it in the inspector without editing code at the lab 
  //if the strongest blendshape is below this, i treat the face as Neutral (nothing really happening)
